/**
 * @dev Provides a way to perform queries on swaps, joins and exits, simulating these operations and returning the exact
 * result they would have if called on the Vault given the current state. Note that the results will be affected by
 * other transactions interacting with the Pools involved.
 *
 * All query functions can be called both on-chain and off-chain.
 *
 * If calling them from a contract, note that all query functions are not `view`. Despite this, these functions produce
 * no net state change, and for all intents and purposes can be thought of as if they were indeed `view`. However,
 * calling them via STATICCALL will fail.
 *
 * If calling them from an off-chain client, make sure to use eth_call: most clients default to eth_sendTransaction for
 * non-view functions.
 *
 * In all cases, the `fromInternalBalance` and `toInternalBalance` fields are entirely ignored: we just use the same
 * structs for simplicity.
