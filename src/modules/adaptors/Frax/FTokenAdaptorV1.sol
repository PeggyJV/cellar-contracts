    //============================================ Interface Helper Functions ===========================================

    //============================== Interface Details ==============================
    // The Frax Pair interface can slightly change between versions.
    // To account for this, FTokenAdaptors will use the below internal functions when
    // interacting with Frax Pairs, this way new pairs can be added by creating a
    // new contract that inherits from this one, and overrides any function it needs
    // so it conforms with the new Frax Pair interface. This adaptor exemplifies how
    // the v1 version of `FraxLendPair` needs to be accomodated due to the slight
    // difference compared to the v2 `FraxLendPair` version.

    // Current versions in use for `FraxLendPair` include v1 and v2.

    // IMPORTANT: This `FTokenAdaptorV1.sol` is associated to the v1 version of `FraxLendPair`
    // whereas the inherited `FTokenAdaptor.sol` is actually associated to `FraxLendPairv2`.
    // The reasoning to name it like this was to set up the base FTokenAdaptor for the
    // most current version, v2. This is in anticipation that more FraxLendPairs will
    // be deployed following v2 in the near future. When later versions are deployed,
    // then the described inheritance pattern above will be used.
