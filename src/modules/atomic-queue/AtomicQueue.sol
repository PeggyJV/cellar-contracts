 * @notice Making atomic requests where the exchange rate between offer and want is not
 *         relatively stable is effectively the same as placing a limit order between
 *         those assets, so requests can be filled at a rate worse than the current market rate.
 * @notice It is possible for a user to make multiple requests that use the same offer asset.
 *         If this is done it is important that the user has approved the queue to spend the
 *         total amount of assets aggregated from all their requests, and to also have enough
 *         `offer` asset to cover the aggregate total request of `offerAmount`.
