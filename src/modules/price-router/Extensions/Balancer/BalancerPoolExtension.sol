        //        // checks the reentrancy flag, with "BAL#400" (corresponding to Errors.REENTRANCY) in the revertData.
        //        // The full revertData will be: `abi.encodeWithSignature("Error(string)", "BAL#400")`.

        //        // If the Vault is not being reentered, the check above will pass: but it will *still* revert,

        //        // failure results in empty revertData.
        //        _status = _ENTERED;
        //    }
        //
        // So based on this analysis, there are only two possible revertData values: empty, or abi.encoded BAL#400.
        //
        // It is of course much more bytecode and gas efficient to check for zero-length revertData than to compare it
        // to the encoded REENTRANCY revertData.
        //
        // While it should be impossible for the call to fail in any other way (especially since it reverts before
        // `manageUserBalance` even gets called), any other error would generate non-zero revertData, so checking for
        // empty data guards against this case too.
