# Fees

Strategists use the Fees and Reserve system to manage the fees generated by the cellar. The fees are generated by the cellar's strategies and are denominated in the holding asset. The plaform cut is managed directly in the Cellar and is a fraction of the total fees generated by the Strategist.

## Reseve

The Reserve is an adapter the hold funds from the cellar. Generally the strategist moves funds into the reserve on a regular basis from profits. The reserve gives the stratgist optionality. Fees must be collected from the reserve but funds in the reserve can also be returned to the cellar if the strategist decides to do so.

## Fees

Fees are storied in the metadata strct of the fees and reserves module. The management fees are computed on NAV and stored as basis points. The peformance fees are computed by tracking a highwater mark of the share from from each fee collection and then computing the fees based on the growth of the share price. New LP shares are minted when the performance fee is collected and that effectively dilutes the existing LPs.

  ## Platform Fees

  When the strategist withdraw fees from the Cellar, the top level platform fee takes a cut for the Sommelier protocol. These fees are sent to the Sommelier chain via the gravity bridge on Ethereum mainnet and the Axelar on other chains. The fees are then auctioned to generate staking rewards.
